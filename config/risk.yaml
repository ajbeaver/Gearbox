  # Global risk limits
  # -------------------------------------------------------------------
  #
  # This file defines non-negotiable risk boundaries.
  # These limits are enforced deterministically by automation and
  # cannot be overridden by the agent, strategy, or runtime mode.
  #
  # If any of these limits are breached, the system must refuse
  # further execution or halt entirely, depending on context.
  #
  # All percentages are relative to total account equity.
  # Maximum allowed loss from peak equity before the system must halt.
  # This represents the worst-case drawdown the system is permitted
  # to experience over its entire lifetime or session.
  #
  # Example:
  #   If equity peaks at $100,000 and this is set to 20,
  #   trading must halt once equity falls to $80,000.
  max_drawdown_pct: 20
  #
  # Maximum total loss allowed within a rolling 24-hour window.
  # This limit exists to prevent rapid compounding losses during
  # extreme volatility or unfavorable market conditions.
  #
  # Breaching this limit should trigger a pause or halt, even if
  # overall drawdown limits have not yet been reached.
  daily_loss_pct: 5
  #
  # Maximum loss allowed on any single trade, relative to total equity.
  # This caps the damage of individual execution mistakes or sudden
  # market moves and prevents one trade from dominating risk.
  #
  # This limit is evaluated per trade, before and after execution.
  max_trade_loss_pct: 2
  #
  # Maximum percentage of total equity that may be allocated to a
  # single open position at any given time.
  #
  # This prevents overexposure to a single asset or correlated move,
  # regardless of strategy confidence.
  max_position_pct: 10
  #
  # Maximum number of concurrent open positions allowed.
  # This limits overall exposure complexity and reduces the risk
  # of hidden correlation across multiple positions.
  max_concurrent_positions: 3
